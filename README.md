# Quarantine Film Festival (30MFF Assignment)

Based on the 30MFF exercise, I wanted to create a website for a hypothetical online film festival.

### Design Concept
Since the site is for an online film festival – something unlikely to ever occur without the pandemic and the dominance of video conferencing – I wanted the site to have a modern feel. I also figured that since the festival is online and features films made by college students, I could afford to be a little more youthful and punchy with the copy and design, hence the mustard yellow color theme.
